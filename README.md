# User Manager

This repository contains a simple demo API built with NodeJS.
The API is used to manage users in a MongoDB database.

### Development
This application was developed using [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/). MongoDB was used for persisting data with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) as [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping).

### Installation

* Ensure that you've `Docker` installed on your PC.
* Clone the repository by entering the command `git clone https://github.com/ibnahmadbello/ALC-Microsoft-Assessment` in the terminal.
* Navigate to the project folder using `cd ALC-Microsoft-Assessment` on your terminal (or command prompt)
* After cloning, run the command `docker-compose up --build` on your terminal.
* For Linux user, ensure to use the `sudo` command.
* Once it is done, go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Testing

The command: `npm test` makes this possible.
